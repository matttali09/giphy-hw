# Fun Giphy Pullin with Ajax

Initially the user starts out with a group of 20 buttons to choose from.

![initial](assets/images/initial.PNG?raw=true "initial")

Users can press on any of these buttons for an ajax pull of 11 gifs functionality

![button-press](assets/images/button-press.PNG?raw=true "button-press")

Then users can input any selection they would like to have a new functional button added

![new-btn](assets/images/new-btn.PNG?raw=true "new-btn")

The users can input anything for an ajax request button. Animals are simply the suggested.
